# VICTSING-P143-Software
I was searching for a new install of this software, since I was switching computers. The software is no where to be found. So here is the software from my old computer. I pray this finds anyone who needs it.

I do not have the original install exe of the software, but I do have the files from my current version. Thankfully this software was not too special so the installer just put this folder in your "C:\Program Files (x86)" folder.

so here is that folder, I should also have a exe file in the releases tab, this is an installer I made for it. I promise I did not put a virus into it lol. Even though I claim this software is for the P143, my mouse of which it works with is the P143A. I am of the belief that the 'A' does not make a difference, and the software works with any P143.

If you want to install with the folder do this:

if you want to use the installer I made just download and run it.

PS: I have had my VICTSING P143A for about 7 years now, It's a great mouse and has never let me down.
