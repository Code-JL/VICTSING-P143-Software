# VICTSING P143 Software

## Windows ONLY.

I was searching for a new install of this software, since I was switching computers. The software is no where to be found. So here is the software from my old computer. I pray this finds anyone who needs it.

I do not have the original install exe of the software, but I do have the files from my current version.

so here is that folder, I should also have a exe file in the releases tab, this is an installer I made for it (Using NSIS). I promise I did not put a virus into it lol. Even though I claim this software is for the P143, my mouse of which it works with is the P143A. I am of the belief that the 'A' does not make a difference, and the software works with any P143.

## Install

If you want to install with the folder, just place the "VICTSING Gaming Mouse" folder in your "C:\Program Files (x86)" folder.

if you want to use the installer I made just download and run it.

## Shortcut

Either Method you do, you will not end up with a Startmenu and/or a Desktop Shortcut. You are going to have to make this yourself:

This is for a desktop shortcut in Windows 10, should be a simular process for windows 11 as well.

go to the Install folder: "C:\Program Files (x86)\VICTSING Gaming Mouse"

Right click the OEMDri.exe

Click "Send to", then click "Desktop"

you will now have the shortcut on your desktop. If you want it to look better you can change the Icon to the "C:\Program Files (x86)\VICTSING Gaming Mouse\appico.ico" file.

## Other

PS: I have had my VICTSING P143A for about 7 years now, It's a great mouse and has never let me down.
